# Welcome to my practice CI/CD repository

This repo uses an example application featured in this [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). The initial code came from this [github](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/microblog).

The goal of this repository is to practice CI/CD using Jenkins.
